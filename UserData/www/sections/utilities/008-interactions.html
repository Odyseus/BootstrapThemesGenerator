<h1>Interactions</h1>
<p>Utility classes that change how users interact with contents of a website.</p>
<h2>Text selection</h2>
<p>Change the way in which the content is selected when the user interacts with it.</p>
<div class="bstg-example">
    <p class="user-select-all">This paragraph will be entirely selected when clicked by the user.</p>
    <p class="user-select-auto">This paragraph has default select behavior.</p>
    <p class="user-select-none">This paragraph will not be selectable when clicked by the user.</p>
</div>
<h2>Pointer events</h2>
<p>Bootstrap provides <code>.pe-none</code> and <code>.pe-auto</code> classes to prevent or add element interactions.</p>
<div class="bstg-example">
    <p><a href="#"
           class="pe-none"
           tabindex="-1"
           aria-disabled="true">This link</a> can not be clicked.</p>
    <p><a href="#"
           class="pe-auto">This link</a> can be clicked (this is default behavior).</p>
    <p class="pe-none"><a href="#"
           tabindex="-1"
           aria-disabled="true">This link</a> can not be clicked because the <code>pointer-events</code> property is inherited from its parent. However, <a href="#"
           class="pe-auto">this link</a> has a <code>pe-auto</code> class and can be clicked.</p>
</div>
<p>The <code>.pe-none</code> class (and the <code>pointer-events</code> CSS property it sets) only prevents interactions with a pointer (mouse, stylus, touch). Links and controls with <code>.pe-none</code> are, by default, still focusable and actionable for keyboard users. To ensure that they are completely neutralized even for keyboard users, you may need to add further attributes such as <code>tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;</code> (to prevent them from receiving keyboard focus) and <code>aria-disabled=&quot;true&quot;</code> (to convey the fact they are effectively disabled to assistive technologies), and possibly use JavaScript to completely prevent them from being actionable.</p>
<p>If possible, the simpler solution is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For form controls, add the <code>disabled</code> HTML attribute.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>For links, remove the <code>href</code> attribute, making it a non-interactive anchor or placeholder link.</li>
</ul>
