<h2>Sticky top</h2>
<p>Position an element at the top of the viewport, from edge to edge, but only after you scroll past it. The <code>.sticky-top</code> utility uses CSS’s <code>position: sticky</code>, which isn’t fully supported in all browsers.</p>
<p><strong>IE11 and IE10 will render <code>position: sticky</code> as <code>position: relative</code>.</strong> As such, we wrap the styles in a <code>@supports</code> query, limiting the stickiness to only browsers that can render it properly.</p>
